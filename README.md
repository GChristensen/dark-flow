Dark Flow 
=========

An advanced imageboard aggregator.

Dark Flow is a complete client-side port of the 
[Dark Matter](https://github.com/GChristensen/dm-browser) 
web-application, which includes all feautres of the former except the archive 
functionality.

Currently Dark Flow could run as:
* A [Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-flow-aggregator/)
* A web-application in a servlet container (including GAE). The web-app uses IndexedDB to 
  store data on a client, this narrows its compatibility to Firefox and Chrome browsers
  (including Android versions).

See the [manual](https://github.com/GChristensen/dark-flow/blob/master/manual.png) for more information.
